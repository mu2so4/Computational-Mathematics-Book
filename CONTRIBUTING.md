# Contributing to Book
Thank you for helping to this project! To make you work easier, here are a
few general guidelines on contributing and reporting bugs and suggesting
new features.

## Reporting issues
The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests
and submitting pull requests, but please respect the following restrictions:
* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use
Stack Overflow).
* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
respect the opinions of others.

## Pull requests
Before sending a new Pull Request, take a look on existing Pull Requests and
Issues to see if the proposed change or fix has been discussed in the past,
or if the change was already implemented but not yet released.

First of all, open an issue and describy what you are going to do. Then:
1. Fork this repo;
2. `git clone` your new repo;
3. `git checkout` to your feature/bugfix branch from the 'develop branch';
4. Commit your bugfix or feature;
5. Merge your feature/bugfix branch into your 'develop' branch;
6. Open a pull request to the 'develop' branch and
[link it to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
7. If your code is clean, PR will be merged. Well done!:heavy_check_mark:
